XOS72996.TXT - Release notes for 7/29/96 XBAND software
=======================================================

This release consists of files that Saturn developers might find useful in
developing head-to-head Saturn games for modem play. The software is roughly
equivalent to the initial Japanese release of the XBAND software with some
minor differences :

- The software is aimed at game developers, not end users. Therefore it will
lack some functionality that end users expect. These limitations should not
have any effect on developers, however.

- The software has been built to run on US modem hardware, rather than
Japenese modem hardware (this is different than the 7/3/96 release of the
software). Specifically, we do not perform the modem ID check that occurs in
the Japanese software. This means that booting the software without a modem
installed will result in incorrect operation should the user attempt to dial.
Also, we store a bit of configuration information in the Saturn internal
backup RAM, rather than on the modem FLASH memory.

- The software has been buiit for peer-to-peer play only, without calling the
XBAND servers. This expedites the development of game software.

- The software has been build with English text, rather than Japanese, for
easier reading by those of us who can't read Japanese (like me!).

- The software does not require the user to enter their own phone number (in
Japan, users have to do this as there is no way for the XBAND servers to
automatically determine this. In the U.S., such a capability exists, so users
don't need to perform this step manually).

- The software requires the use of a SegaSaturn "red disc", or the use of a
Smallbox (VCD) development kit, to run the XBAND UI software. Developers can
also use a CartDev or similar device if they wish to use the Head To Head
Game Library alone. Details are contained within the XBLIB.DOC documentation
file.

Included in this release are the following files :
==================================================

To be built onto the CD :
DRAMDB.BIN        (XBAND data file)
FLD_KNL.BIN       (Sega library used to transition from XBAND into the game)
GAMEINFO.BIN      (Game-specific information file, documented in XBLIB.DOC)
SAMPLEIP.BIN      (Game-specific IP file ... tells where game binary is loaded)
XBAND.DAT         (Yet another XBAND data file)
XBLIBUS.bin       (XBAND Head-To-Head Game Library file)
XBMAP.BIN         (Disc-specific file that tells XBAND where to find the game)
ip.bin            (XBAND's Initial Program)
loader.bin        (XBAND loader file ... decides if game or XBAND is launched)
xband.bin         (XBAND executable itself)
smp.bin           (Sega's sample game "battle-cubes")

To build the CD :
xband.scr         (script file to build sample disc)

Program headers :
XBANDLib.h        (header file for XBAND Head-To-Head game library)

Documentation :
XOS72996.TXT      (this file)
XBLIB.DOC         (Head-To-Head Game Library documentation, MSWord 5 format)

How to build a CD with the sample game ("battle-cubes")
=======================================================

Place all the files (except the documentation, which isn't needed for building
the CD) into a directory on the PC that has the Sega Saturn CDROM tools
(VCDBUILD, VCDMKTOC, VCDEMU, SEGACDW).

In DOS, with that directory as the current directory, type :

VCDBUILD XBAND

(The PC should print a bunch of status). Next, type :

VCDMKTOC XBAND

(More status from the PC. I'd love to know why this step is separate :>  )

Now the CD disc is ready. Either use "VCDEMU XBAND" to run the CD emulator with
a smallbox, or insert a blank CD-R disc into the CD-R drive and type :

SEGACDW XBAND

(I personally use an option like "-s 1" or "-s 2" to burn the CD at a lower
speed, as some blank CD-Rs don't seem to like the default 4x recording speed.
Your mileage may vary.)

How to use the Peer-To-Peer development XBAND software
======================================================
This version of the XBAND software is meant for play without the need to call
the XBAND server. Also, it is only meant for development purposes, not for
end-users. Therefore, special knowledge is needed to make it work properly.

First, get two modem setups running. On one modem (which will be known as the
"slave" modem, the modem that answers the telephone), choose one of the
characters and set the Code Name to be something starting with the letters "SP"
(for example, "Spleen". Don't worry, UNIX-heads, it's not case-sensitive).

OK, how does one change a Code Name? Well, when the software first powers up,
you will see a splash screen. Pressing a button will get you to a screen where
you will see four player icons, with four Code Names below them. This is where
the user can choose which player they wish to use. If the Saturn does not have
any XBAND configuration stored in backup RAM, the code names will all be "New
Player". In this case, selecting one will move the user to the "Enter Your Code
Name" screen. If a code name already exists, then selecting a character will
put you into the "main" screen, which has the Challenge button, the Player List
button, etc.   Choose the "Options" button (which has a Key icon). Inside of
Options, there is a button called "Player ID". Choose that. Inside of "Player
ID", choose "Code Name".

Now you're in a screen ("Enter Your Code Name") that has some helpful text near
the top, a text entry field in the middle, and an on-screen keyboard on the
bottom. Use the D-pad to navigate the green cursor over the on-screen keyboard,
use the A button to type a Space character, the B button to backspace, and the
C button to choose whatever letter the cursor has beneath it. The Y and Z
buttons are shift buttons (not necesary for this), and the X button actually
cycles between keyboards (Roman and a pair of Japanese keyboards), so don't be
alarmed if you accidentally make the keyboard a bunch of Japanese glyphs. Once
done editing your code name, head for the "OK" button in the lower-right.
You'll also notice some Japanese buttons in the right column. The second from
the bottom is "Cancel", if you need to use that instead.

If you're lucky enough to have a real (hardware) keyboard, you should be able
to use that instead of the Saturn controller to expedite entering text.

The Peer-To-Peer software looks at the Code Name and sees the "SP" which
tells it to go into Slave mode (that's the S part) and also to use
PeerDataExchange before the game (this is the P part. The PeerDataExchange is
a data exchange between the XBAND software that occurs after the peers
connect, but before the game itself is launched). For the slave modem, the
rest of the Code Name is ignored.

Next, on the second modem, choose a character and set that character's Code
Name to the name "MP5551212" (replacing 5551212 with whatever phone number
you wish to dial to reach the slave modem from the master modem. This number
will depend upon your configuration - certain phone-line simulators just want
to hear one or more digits, others require a specific sequence. Or if you use
standard phone lines, you'll just want the phone number for the slave modem).
The "M" stands for "master" (dialing) modem, and the "P" continues to mean
"PeerDataExchange".

Back on the slave modem, navigate to the "Challenge" button. Select it, and
a dialog will ask if you wish to register with XBAND. Choose Yes. You'll
see a screen come up, then disappear, and you'll return to the main
("Challenge" / "Player List" / etc.) screen. You'll also notice some text
scrolling that says "Waiting for Call". You've told the slave modem to
auto-answer for the next two minutes.

Now go back to the master modem. Select the Challenge button, and reply "Yes"
to the dialog box that asks if you'd like to register. Now you'll see a
screen appear, then disappear, then a screen will appear, saying "Dialing
Peer xxx". The master will dial the slave, they should negotiate and exchange
information, then a screen should appear showing the two opponents
side-by-side. This is known as the "Versus screen". After awhile, or when
someone gets impatient and starts pressing a button, the software will then
launch the game (you should see the Sega logo screen, followed by the game).
Play the game (really, it's fun to have two cubes shooting at each other)
and when someone wins, have one of the users decline to play again. The
modems should disconnect, and the XBAND user interface should reappear. Most
likely, the XBAND software will ask you if you wish to add the opponent to
the Player List. Reply "No" and the software should then return to the main
screen. At this point, you've successfully run the game once. To repeat,
you won't need to re-enter code names or anything. Just remember to "Challenge"
with the slave (answering) modem first, then the master (dialing) modem.

OK, where is the configuration information (Code Names, etc.) stored?
=====================================================================
Right now, a small amount of configuration information (phone configuration,
Code Names, and the like) are stored in a small file in the Saturn Backup RAM.
The title is "XBAND" and the comment is "MY_COMMENT". If you wish to reset
your configuration, use the Saturn boot ROM's Memory control panel, as with
other Backup RAM data.

It is quite likely that the contents of the backup RAM file will change with
subsequent releases of this software. As the file contains version information,
it will most likely automatically be discarded.

Alright, where do I go from here?
=================================
The file XBLIB.DOC has documentation on how to use the XBAND Head To Head Game
Library. The main body of this documentation is how to use the Head To Head
Game Library. An appendix contains information on packaging and building
CD-ROMs. There's also information on issues with game synchronization using
the Head To Head library.

The file XBANDLib.h contains the actual program interface to the Head To Head
Game Library. Use this header from within the portion of your game that needs
to interface with the game library.
